## Whatâ€™s the Deal?
I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0-GjIm0HD0) and realized you can set up a bot to spot price differences across exchanges and profit from it. The code in this repo is just the start, so you can try it too.

## Why Itâ€™s Lit

- Codeâ€™s free, Iâ€™m messing with it myself.
- The video breaks it all down nice and easy.
